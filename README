SDLx-Tween version 0.01
======================

NOT READY YET

Will be an XS tween engine in for SDL Perl.

Only built on Linux so far.

EXAMPLES

    01-circle.pl       - the hello world of tweening, a growing circle
    02-starfield.pl    - demo of 4000 concurrent tweens
    03-easing.pl       - demo of all easing functions

TODO

    - paths
        * bezier
    - easing
        * stepped ease for retro shaky animations    
    - timeline control
        * pause/resume
        * ffw/rewind/seek/elasetic time factor
        * sequence/parallel
    - callback proxy
    - custom tweens
        * color/brightness/opacity
        * sprite animation
        * spawner
        * rotation/scaling
        * position - with distinct int optimization in 2D
        * shape tweening using lots of particles
    - tween manager
        * auto connects tween to SDL controller    
        * weak set of tweens
    - docs
    - demos
        * paths
        * add trails to easing demo, make them tween fade
        * follow cursor dynamic properties
        * start/stop of tweens
    - API features
        - dynamic params
        - delay before/after tween
        * validation should be in validation classes to get rid of all those ifs in constructor    
        * lifecycle events -> start,stop,complete
        * method proxy should not keep strong ref to target
        * speed instead of duration
        * tween group for sequencing
    - performance
        * share path_args for polylines
        * pool tweens
        * convert doubles to floats
    - accuracy
        * overshoot support
        * chaining tweens passes complete->start cycle times
