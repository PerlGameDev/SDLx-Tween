SDLx-Tween version 0.01
=======================

SDL Perl XS tweening lib

STATUS: Starting to be almost ready enough to be somewhat useful

Only built on Linux.


Writing Perl SDL game move handlers is hard. Consider a missile with 3 states:

    - firing - some sprite animation
    - flying towards enemy - need to update its position until it hits enemy
    - exploding - another sprite animation

The move handler for this game object (GOB) is hard to write, because it needs to:

    * update GOB properties
    * you must take into account acceleration and paths in the computation of
      these values
    * you need to set limits of the values, wait for the limits
    * GOBs need to act differently according to their state, so you need to
      manage that as well
    * it all must be very accurate, or animations will miss each other
    * it has to be fast- this code is run per each GOB per each update

SDLx::Tween lib can do some of these things. Instead of writing a move handler,
declare tweens on your GOBs. SDLx::Tween will take over the move handler for
you.

Instead of writing a move handler which updates a $my_gob position from x=0
to x=100 in 1 second, you can go:

    SDLx::Tween::Timeline
        ->tween(on => [x => $my_gob], range => [0, 100], t => 1_000)
        ->start;

And SDLx::Tween will setup the correct move handler.

Move handlers are rarely a simple linear progression. The tween library
can change GOBs in many ways:

    - tween any property, to a callback, or directly on an array
    - tween a property with several dimensions, e.g. xy position, 4D color space
    - tween xy position not on a line, but on some curve
    - smooth the motion with acceleration/deceleration
    - chain tweens, paralellize tween, e.g start explode tween after reaching target
    - make the tween bounce, repeat for N cycles or forever
    - pause/resume/rewind/ffw/reverse/seek tweens, and generaly play with elastic time
      for making the game faster or slower
    - hasten/slow a tween, for example when creeps are suddenly given a speed bonus
    - tween sprite frames, color/opacity/brightness/saturation/hue, volume/pitch,
      spawning, rotation, size, camera position

According to:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweening

    "In the inbetweening workflow of traditional hand-drawn animation, the
    senior or key artist would draw the keyframes ... and then would hand over
    the scene to his or her assistant the inbetweener who does the rest."

Let SDLx-Tween be your inbetweener.

EXAMPLES

    01-circle.pl       - the hello world of tweening, a growing circle
    02-starfield.pl    - demo of 4000 concurrent tweens
    03-easing.pl       - demo of all easing functions
    04-paths.pl        - demo of all paths


TODO: syntax sugar above is still unimplemented, current syntax is:

    SDLx::Tween::Timeline->tween(
        on       => [x => $my_gob],
        duration => 1000,
        from     => 0,
        to       => 100,
    )->start;


TODO

    - paths
        * bezier
    - easing
        * stepped ease for retro shaky animations    
    - timeline control
        * ffw/rewind/seek/elasetic time factor
        * sequence/parallel
    - callback proxy
    - tween types
        * more color transforms
        * sprite animation
        * spawner
        * rotation/scaling
        * distinct int optimization in 2D for position, and for array proxy
        * shape tweening using lots of particles
    - timeline
        * auto connect directly to SDL app
    - docs
    - demos
        * add trails to easing demo, make them tween fade
        * start/stop of tweens
        * rain falling
    - API features
        * delay before/after tween
        * validation should be in validation classes to get rid of all those ifs in constructor    
        * lifecycle events -> start,stop,complete
        * method proxy should not keep strong ref to target
        * speed instead of duration
        * tween group for sequencing
        * sugarize
    - performance
        * share path_args for polylines
        * pool tweens
        * convert doubles to floats
    - accuracy
        * overshoot support
        * chaining tweens passes complete->start cycle times
